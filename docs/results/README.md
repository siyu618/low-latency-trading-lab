# docs/results — committed measurement datasets

This directory holds only **real, committed** measurement data, organized by
measurement family. Transient raw runs land in repo-root `results/`
(git-ignored) and are moved here only after inspection.

## Layout

- `phase2-m3max/` — the Phase 2 canonical **throughput** dataset: steady-state
  `apply()` ns/update across both books, five workloads, four scales, measured
  on the Apple M3 Max dev machine. Frozen, independent — used only for
  high-level cross-platform trend comparison, never as the absolute latency
  paired with Linux perf counters. See its `RESULTS_METADATA.md`.
- `phase3-linux-<machine>/` — Phase 3 **Linux perf** counter data (one
  subdirectory per profiled cell) **plus a same-host Linux throughput
  baseline** from that machine/compiler/build — Linux counters are read against
  Linux latency, never against the M3 Max CSV. Not yet present — Phase 3B is
  pending; see `docs/profiling/README.md`.

## Honesty rule

Never invent numbers. A dataset enters `docs/results/` only from a real run,
with provenance (machine, compiler/flags, perf version, the raw tool output,
the exact command) recorded next to it. Illustrative output elsewhere in the
repo is always labeled as such.
